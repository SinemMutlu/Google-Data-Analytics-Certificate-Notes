## The life cycle of data: 

1. **Plan:** Decide what kind of data is needed, how it will be managed, and who will be responsible for it.
  
2. **Capture:** Collect or bring in data from a variety of different sources.
   - **Database:** Database is a collection of data stored in a computer system.
  
3. **Manage:** Care for and maintain the data. This includes determining how and where it is stored and the tools used to do so. This phase is very important to data cleansing.

4. **Analyze:** Use the data to solve problems, make decisions, and support business goals.

5. **Archive:** Keep relevant data stored for long-term and future reference.

6. **Destroy:** Remove data from storage and delete any shared copies of the data.

# Key Data Analyst Tools

## Spreadsheets

Data analysts rely on spreadsheets to collect and organize data. Two popular spreadsheet applications you will probably use a lot in your future role as a data analyst are Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets. 

Spreadsheets structure data in a meaningful way by letting you 

  - Collect, store, organize, and sort information

  - Identify patterns and piece the data together in a way that works for each specific data project

  - Create excellent data visualizations, like graphs and charts. 

## Databases and query languages

A database is a collection of structured data stored in a computer system. Some popular Structured Query Language (SQL) programs include MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and BigQuery.

### Query languages 

- Allow analysts to isolate specific information from a database(s)

- Make it easier for you to learn and understand the requests made to databases

- Allow analysts to select, create, add, or download data from a database for analysis

## Visualization tools
Data analysts use a number of visualization tools, like graphs, maps, tables, charts, and more. Two popular visualization tools are Tableau and Looker.

### These tools 

- Turn complex numbers into a story that people can understand 

- Help stakeholders come up with conclusions that lead to informed decisions and effective business strategies  

- Have multiple features 

             - Tableau's simple drag-and-drop feature lets users create interactive graphs in dashboards and worksheets 

             - Looker communicates directly with a database, allowing you to connect your data right to the visual tool you choose 

A career as a data analyst also involves using programming languages, like R and Python, which are used a lot for statistical analysis, visualization, and other data analysis.

Spreadsheets and databases both offer ways to store, manage, and use data. The basic content for both tools are sets of values. Yet, there are some key differences, too:
