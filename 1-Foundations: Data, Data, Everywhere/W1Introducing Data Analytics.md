### Data
Data is a collection of facts. This collection can include numbers, pictures, videos, words, measurements, observations, and more. 

### Data Analysis 
Data analysis is the collection, transformation, and organization of data in order to draw conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making.

### Data Analyst
Data analyst is someone who collects, transforms, and organizes data in order to help make informed decisions.

**Data science**, the discipline of making data useful, is an umbrella term that encompasses three disciplines: **machine learning, statistics, and analytics**. 

- If you want to make a few important decisions under uncertainty, that is statistics. The excellence of statistics is rigor. Statisticians are essentially philosophers,
epistemologists. They are very, very careful about protecting decision-makers from coming to the wrong conclusion.

- If you want to automate, in other words, make many, many, many decisions under uncertainty, that is machine learning and AI. Performance is the excellence of the 
machine learning and AI engineer.

- But what if you don't know how many decisions you want to make before you begin? What if what you're looking for is inspiration? You want to encounter your unknown 
unknowns. You want to understand your world. That is analytics. The excellence of an analyst is speed. How quickly can you surf through vast amounts of data to explore
it and discover the gems, the beautiful potential insights that are worth knowing about and bringing to your decision-makers? 

### Data Ecosystem
An ecosystem is a group of elements that interact with one another. 
Data ecosystems are made up of various elements that interact with one another in order to produce, manage, store, organize, analyze, and share data. These elements 
include hardware and software tools, and the people who use them.
Let's think about a data ecosystem used by a human resources department. This ecosystem would include information like postings from job websites, stats on the 
current labor market, employment rates, and social media data on prospective employees.

### Data Science 
Data science is defined as creating new ways of modeling and understanding the unknown by using raw data. 
Data scientists create new questions using data, while analysts find answers to existing questions by creating insights from data sources. 

### Data Analytics
Data analytics in the simplest terms is the science of data. It's a very broad concept that encompasses everything from the job of managing and using data to the 
tools and methods that data workers use each and every day.
It's important to understand that data, data analysis and data ecosystem fit under the data analytics umbrella.

### Data-driven Decision-making
Data-driven decision-making is defined as using facts to guide business strategy. It gives you greater confidence about your choice and your abilities to address
business challenges. It helps you become more proactive when an opportunity presents itself, and it saves you time and effort when working towards a goal. The first 
step in data-driven decision-making is figuring out the business need. 
It's important to note that no matter how valuable data-driven decision-making is, data alone will never be as powerful as data combined with human experience, 
observation, and sometimes even intuition. To get the most out of data-driven decision-making, it's important to include insights from people who are familiar 
with the business problem.

### The six steps of the data analysis process:
- Ask questions and define the problem.
- Prepare data by collecting and storing the information.
- Process data by cleaning and checking the information.
- Analyze data to find patterns, relationships, and trends.
- Share data with your audience.
- Act on the data and use the analysis results.

### Gut Instinct
Gut instinct is an intuitive understanding of something with little or no explanation. This isn’t always something conscious; we often pick up on signals without 
even realizing. You just have a “feeling” it’s right. Decisions based on gut instinct without any data to back them up can cause mistakes.

***Data + business knowledge = mystery solved***

Blending data with business knowledge, plus maybe a touch of gut instinct, will be a common part of your process as a junior data analyst. The key is figuring out 
the exact mix for each particular project. A lot of times, it will depend on the goals of your analysis.

### Data Analysis Life Cycle
The process of going from data to decision.

Data goes through several phases as it gets created, consumed, tested, processed, and reused. With a life cycle model, all key team members can drive success by 
planning work both up front and at the end of the data analysis process. While the data analysis life cycle is well known among experts, there isn't a single 
defined structure of those phases. There might not be one single architecture that’s uniformly followed by every data analysis expert, but there are some shared 
fundamentals in every data analysis process.
