## Analytical Skills 
Analytical skills are qualities and characteristics associated with solving problems using facts.

### Essential aspects to analytical skills:

•	Curiosity

Curiosity is all about wanting to learn something.

•	Understanding context

Context is the condition in which something exists or happens. This can be a structure or an environment.

•	Having technical mindset

A technical mindset involves the ability to break things down into smaller steps or pieces and work with them in an orderly and logical way.

•	Data design

Data design is how you organize information.

•	Data strategy

Data strategy is the management of the people, processes, and tools used in data analysis.

## Analytical Thinking
Analytical thinking involves identifying and defining a problem and then solving it by using data in an organized, step-by-step manner.
The five key aspects to analytical thinking. 

•	Visualization

Visualization is the graphical representation of information. Some examples include graphs, maps, or other design elements.

•	Strategy

Strategizing helps data analysts see what they want to achieve with the data and how they can get there. Strategy also helps improve the quality and usefulness of the data we collect. By strategizing, we know all our data is valuable and can help us accomplish our goals.

•	Problem-orientation

Data analysts use a problem- oriented approach in order to identify, describe, and solve problems. It's all about keeping the problem top of mind throughout the entire project.

•	Correlation

Being able to identify a correlation between two or more pieces of data. Correlation does not equal causation. In other words, just because two pieces of data are both trending in the same direction, that doesn't necessarily mean they are all related.

•	Big-picture and detail-oriented thinking

Big-picture thinking is being able to see the big picture as well as the details. Detail-oriented thinking is all about figuring out all of the aspects that will help you execute a plan.

## Why is it important to think in different ways? 
Because in data analysis, solutions are almost never right in front of you. You need to think critically to find out the right questions to ask. But you also need to think creatively to get new and unexpected answers.

## Few examples of the kinds of questions data analysts use at their jobs every day:
### - What is the root cause of a problem?
#### Root Cause
The reason why a problem occurs. If we can identify and get rid of a root cause, we can prevent that problem from happening again.

#### Five Whys
In the Five Whys you ask "why" five times to reveal the root cause. The fifth and final answer should give you some useful and sometimes surprising insights.

### - Where are the gaps in our process?
#### Gap Analysis
A method for examining and evaluating how a process works currently in order to get where you want to be in the future. 
The general approach to gap analysis is understanding where you are now compared to where you want to be. Then you can identify the gaps that exist between the current and future state and determine how to bridge them.

### - What did we not consider before? 
This is a great way to think about what information or procedure might be missing from a process, so you can identify ways to make better decisions and strategies moving forward.
